Figure out what's the sensible variable type for offset.  The code
should support huge (> 4 GB) XML files on >= 64-bit systems.

Figure out how to deal with characters and the buffer, whether it is
more sensisble to "read" a unicode character once and pass it around
or just work on the buffer.

Use iteration instead of recursion for security reasons, as exhausting
the stack has unpredictable results.
