Smash XML

This project is available under the LGPL, and will possibly also be
released under some permissive BSD-style license.

The aim is to create a secure and blazingly fast XML parser and writer
written in standard (simple & portable) C, perhaps making use of some
cross-platform libraries.

** Important note **

If you're compiling Smash XML on an unusual system, remember to run
the test-suite before using it in development or production.

** To-do **

Add (contrived) tests to check that it isn't possible to overrun any
buffers.

WithEndingSlash from test.xml doesn't appear in print_tree output.
