Smash XML

This project is available under the LGPL, and will possibly also be
released under some permissive BSD-style license.

The aim is to create a secure and blazingly fast XML parser and writer
written in standard (simple & portable) C, perhaps making use of some
cross-platform libraries.

** Important note **

If you're compiling Smash XML on an unusual system, remember to run
the test-suite before using it in development or production.
